# Espresso Orders Dashboard: Analyzing Coffee Sales Trends & Insights

This project is a comprehensive analysis of coffee sales using data from multiple worksheets in Excel. By leveraging various Excel functions such as XLOOKUP, I was able to integrate data from different sources, clean the data by removing duplicates, and create meaningful insights that showcase sales trends, customer behavior, and product preferences.
The following files are attached to support the analysis:

coffeeOrdersData.xlsx: Contains raw data for espresso orders, which was cleaned and processed to generate insights.

The dashboard provides an interactive and dynamic view of coffee sales from 2019 to 2022, using a combination of data visualizations and key metrics. Key features of the dashboard include:

## Coffee Sales by Country:
This metric breaks down coffee sales across different countries, offering insights into geographic trends and helping identify regions with the highest demand.

## Top Five Customers: 
An overview of the top five customers based on coffee orders, allowing businesses to focus on their most valuable clients.

## Slicers: 
Interactive slicers for filtering the data based on loyalty status, coffee bean size, and roast type. These filters make it easy to explore the data and gain targeted insights.

## Sales Over Time:
A bar chart depicting the total sales over the years, providing a clear visual representation of how coffee sales have evolved.

By integrating these metrics and visualizations, the dashboard allows users to explore and analyze coffee sales data in a way that is both insightful and easy to navigate. The interactive features make it a powerful tool for anyone looking to understand key sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance over time.

This project not only demonstrates advanced Excel skills such as XLOOKUP, data cleaning, and charting but also shows how to create a dynamic dashboard that enables data-driven decision-making.
